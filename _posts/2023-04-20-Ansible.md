## ANSIBLE

### Creating SSH key for the servers

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "learning ansible" -f id_ansible
```

- That SSH key will be added to any server I create on Digital Ocean. This will ensure Ansible can log into any server we want to provision.

### Connecting to the servers

```bash
ssh -o "IdentitiesOnly yes" -i ~/.ssh/id_ansible root@[server-ip-here]
```

### Install Ansible

```bash
# Run this if we don't have the "add-apt-repository" command
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common

# Add Ansible's official repository
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible

# Update repositories

# Install Ansible
sudo apt-get install -y ansible

# Ensure installed
which ansible
```

### Reference

```bash
# About ansible
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html

```

### Configure Ansible

```bash
# make a backup of ansible hosts file
sudo mv /etc/ansible/hosts /etc/ansible/hosts.bak

# add hosts to ansible hosts file
sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
```

- Edit `/etc/ansible/hosts` and make it look like this

```ini
# Example of the contents of `/etc/ansible/hosts`
[web]
104.131.7.243
104.131.28.172
104.131.43.90
```

### Run Some Commands on Each Host

```bash
# Run ping as user root on each server
ansible all -m ping -u root
```

- We run into an SSH error, it doesn't find the correct key, falling back to password.
- Instead, we try the following, which works:

```bash
ansible all -m ping -u root --private-key=~/.ssh/id_ansible

ansible all -m shell -a "ping -c 3 localhost"-u root --private-key=~/.ssh/id_ansible
```

### Install Nginx

- We'll use the "apt" module to install Nginx across each server. This let's us declaratively tell Ansible what we want the desired state to be.

```bash
ansible all -m apt -a "pkg=nginx state=latest update_cache=true" -u root --private-key=~/.ssh/id_ansible
```


## Playbooks

- We'll use Playbooks to allow some more orchestration and follow a more configuration steps.

```bash
mkdir ansible
cd ansible

# Create a playbook named "nginx.yml"
vim nginx.yml
```

- The `nginx.yml` file:
```
---
 - hosts: web
   sudo: yes
   user: root
   tasks:
    - name: Add Nginx Repository
      apt_repository: repo='ppa:nginx/stable' state=present
      register: ppainstalled

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt: pkg=nginx state=latest update_cache=true
      when: ppainstalled|success
      notify:
       - Start Nginx

   handlers:
    - name: Start Nginx
      service: name=nginx state=started
```

- Once that's saved, we can run this via the `ansible-playbook` command:

```ansible
# Running ansible-playbook
ansible-playbook --private-key=~/.ssh/id_ansible nginx.yml
```

- This will connect to the servers, gather facts about it, and change what needs to be changed to accomplished the tasks defined.

## Ansible:Roles

- Use Ansible roles to orchestrate more complex configurations.Let's create a new directory named `nginx`, which will be a Role. Then we'll create the basic structure of a Role:

```bash
mkdir -p roles/nginx
cd roles/nginx
mkdir files handlers meta templates tasks vars
```

### Meta

- We'll start with the `meta` information:
- This `meta/main.yml` file creates a dependency on the "sslcertificates" role:

```
---
dependencies:
 - { role: sslcertificates }
```

- However we don't have a dependency currently, so our meta data file looks like this:

```
---
dependencies: []
```

### Files

- I grab Nginx configuration from H5Bp

```bash
cd roles/nginx/files

# Get the H5BP Nginx repository
wget https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx/archive/master.zip

# Save the "h5bp" directory and discard the rest
unzip master.zip
rm master.zip
mv server-configs-nginx/h5bp ../
rm -rf server-configs
```

- Now we have files `roles/nging/files/h5bp`.

### Variables

- Next we'll add some variables to be used in this role. Create `roles/nginx/vars/main.yml`.

```
---
domain: serversforhackers.com
```

### Templates

- We'll create an Nginx configuration file using templates. Templates let us create a file which contain variables, loops and other items as allowed in Python's Jinja2 template engine.

- I create file `roles/nginx/templates/serversforhackers.com.j2` to create the Jinja2 Nginx configuration template for the `serversforhackers.com` site.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name *.{{ domain }};
    return 301 http://{{ domain }};
}

server {
    listen 80 default_server;

    root /var/www/{{ domain }};
    index index.html index.htm;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/{{ domain }}.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/{{ domain }}-error.log error;

    server_name {{ domain }};

    charset utf-8;

    include h5bp/basic.conf;

    location /favicon.ico { log_not_found off; access_log off;}
    location /robots.txt  { log_not_found off; access_log off;}

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri =404;
    }
}
```

### Handler

- Create some handlers. Create file `roles/nginx/handlers/main.yml`:

```
---
- name: Start Nginx
  service: name=nginx state=started

- name: Reload Nginx
  service: name=nginx state=reloaded
```

### Tasks

- Finally we put everything together in our tasks file. Create file `roles/nginx/tasks/main.yml`:

```
---
- name: Add Nginx Repository
  apt_repository: repo='ppa:nginx/stable' state=present

- name: Install Nginx
  apt: pgk=nginx state=latest update_cache=true
  notify:
   - Start Nginx

- name: Add H5BP Config
  copy: src=h5bp dest=/etc/nginx owner=root group=root

- name: Disable Default Config
  file: dest=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/defalt state=absent
  notify:
    - Reload Nginx

- name: Add SFH Site Config
  template: src=serversforhackers.com.j2 dest=/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ domain }} owner=root group=root

- name: Enable SFH Site Config
  file: src=/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ domain }} dest=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/{{ domain }} state=link
  notify:
    - Reload Nginx
```

### Test, Debug and Run Role

- Finally we can try running this Role. In the same directory as the `roles` directory, create a new yaml file such as `run.yml`. In this video, I use file `nginx.yml` since we only use the Nginx role:

```
---
 - hosts: web
   sudo: yes
   user: root
   roles:
    - nginx
```

- We can run this Playbook like so:

```bash
ansible-playbook --private-key=~/.ssh/id_ansible nginx.yml
```

- Let's do a syntax check, which you should run before trying out a playbook or role:

```bash
ansible-playbook --syntax-check nginx.yml
```


# Ansible: Using Vault

- Use Ansible vault to protect sensitive data witin your Ansible Roles!Let's see how to encrypt sensitive data in our Roles so we can use Ansible to handle sensitive data such as SSH private keys or passwords.
- We'll create users on our server using Ansible, which will give us the opportunity to use Ansible Vault.

### Setup "Users" role:

- create

```bash
cd roles
mkdir users
cd users
mkdir files handlers meta templates tasks vars
```

### Meta

- We'll define no dependencies for this role:

```
---
dependencies: []
```

### Variables

- We want this file to be encrypted. Create `roles/users/variables` with Ansible Vault:
- This command is run from the `roles/users` directory:

```bash
ansible-vault create vars/main.yml
```

- Create a password for your vault and confirm it.
- This will open a file to open in your editor of choice (defaults to Vim, or whatever is your default editor).

	If you want to use nano over vim, export the EDITOR variable and set it to nano: `export EDITOR=nano`

- Exit the main.yml file if you have not yet already. We'll create some passwords using the `mkpasswd` command using the SHA-512 method:

```bash
# Whois package contains "mkpasswd" command
sudo apt-get install -y whois

# Create a password for a user
mkpasswd --method=SHA-512
```

- copy the password hash generated, and edit the `vars/main.yml` file again using Vault:

```bash
ansible-vault edit vars/main.yml
```

- Add your passwords and other data:

```
---
admin_password: <a generated password hash>
deploy_password: <another generated password hash>
shared_publickey: <your SSH public key to be placed in servers authorized_keys directory>
```

- Save and quit that file. If you edit the file without Vault, you'll see that the file is encrypted.
- Other `ansible-vault` commands available are seen via:

```bash
ansible-vault -h
```

### Tasks

- Now that we created secure variables, we can use them in a task. Create file `tasks/main.yml`:

```
---
- name: Create Admin User
  user: name=admin password="{{ admin_password }}" groups=sudo shell=/bin/bash

- name: Add Admin Authorized Key
  authorized_key: user=admin key="{{ shared_publickey }}" state=present

- name: Create Deploy User
  user: name=deploy password="{{ deploy_password }}" groups=www-data shell=/bin/bash

- name: Add Deploy Authorized Key
  authorized_key: user=deploy key="{{ shared_publickey }}" state=present
```

- Now adjust the `nginx.yml` file to be named `servers.yml` and run it.

```
---
 - hosts: web
   sudo: yes
   user: root
   roles:
    - nginx
    - users
```

- Test it and then run it:

```bash
ansible-playbook --syntax-check --ask-vault-pass servers.yml
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass --private-key=~/.ssh/id_ansible servers.yml
```

- Then we can log into our servers and check to ensure the servers exist.
- On a remote server:

```
# Check for user "admin" and "deploy"
cat /etc/passwd
```

- From the local computer, try logging in as one of the new users!

```bash
# For me, logging in using the Ansible SSH key looked like this:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ansible admin@104.131.43.90
```
